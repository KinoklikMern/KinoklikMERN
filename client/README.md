#Create and Configure .env Files:
You have two .env files, one for the client and one for the server.
Place these files in the respective directories: client/.env and server/.env.
In the server .env file, update the MAIL_TRAP_USER and MAIL_TRAP_PASS values with your Mailtrap SMTP settings.
#Mailtrap Setup:
If you don't have a Mailtrap account, sign up at Mailtrap.
Find your SMTP settings in Mailtrap, and replace the MAIL_TRAP_USER and MAIL_TRAP_PASS values in the server's .env file with your Mailtrap credentials.
Server Setup:
Open a new terminal.
Navigate to the server directory:
$cd server
Install project dependencies:
$npm install
Update the dependencies (if needed):
$npm update
Start the server:
$npm start
Client Setup:
Open another new terminal.
Navigate to the client directory:
$cd client
Install project dependencies:
$npm install
Update the dependencies (if needed):
$npm update
Start the client application:
$npm start
Register:
After running the client application, open your web browser and navigate to the localhost address (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
You should be able to register on the website.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
